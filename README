libblockalloc -- block allocation library and ftrace-lite

libblockalloc is a library that allows you to basically malloc and
free blocks on a disk.  It is able to sync data, keep track of the
used and free blocks, and naively cache recently used data.  This
library is incomplete (needs a read, write, arb free, and arb malloc)
but still might be useful.

ftrace-lite is a quick hack to allow libblockalloc to compile on all
plan 9/9front systems.  ftrace-lite, when enabled, prints out some of
whats happening inside of the library to help with debugging and
streamlining.  It isn't as good as the full ftrace (ftrace-lite isn't
able to follow system calls into the kernel or blurt out mallocs and
frees, only covers qlock, etc...) but it does some of the job.

I didn't really test this library at all before releasing it.  When
you find bugs, bitch at me and mail me a patch.

Love,
